# Parallel Programming with Java:
# Parallelizing Monte Carlo Function Optimisation

## Description
Monte Carlo algorithm for
finding the minimum (the lowest point) of a two-dimensional mathematical function
f(x,y) within a specified range.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the directory of the folder containing folders bin and src
2. Compile the program with make
3. When running the program input make run ARGS="arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5 arg6 arg7"
   Where args={rows, columns, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, Search Density}
4. The program will run the parallel version of the algorithm and output the results of the search.
